      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>The Love Drops is a music project. We rewrite and parody existing songs for our own amusement and that of others. It‚Äôs a singalong - we invite others to sing with us so everyone‚Äôs in the band! Some of our songs are written for specific events and others cover themes we enjoy covering. Sometimes we perform at parties and festivals.</p>
      <p>We have never used AI to help write our songs. If we ever do, we‚Äôll disclose that in the writers list which appears with each song.</p>
