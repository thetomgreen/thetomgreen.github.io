      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>The Love Drops is a music project. We rewrite and parody existing songs for our own amusement and that of others. It‚Äôs a singalong - we invite others to sing with us so everyone‚Äôs in the band! Some of our songs are written for specific events and others cover themes we enjoy covering. Sometimes we perform at parties and festivals.</p>
      <p>We have never used AI to help write our songs. If we ever do, we‚Äôll disclose that in the writers list which appears with each song.</p>
      <p>This is an open project. If you like our songs, please use ‚Äòem!</p>
      <p>We‚Äôre delighted for others to use these songs. They are provided under a Creative Commons license which has the following conditions:</p>

        <li>Derivative works are permitted (encouraged, actually!), as long as these are shared under the same Creative Commons license.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>We request</strong> (these are friendly requests, not conditions of use):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you use them, let us know, tell us how it went, and send pics / videos if you can</li>
        <li>If you make derivative works, share them with us so we can all enjoy your improvements</li>
        <li>If you write additional songs in a similar style, we‚Äôd love to have access to them</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you want to use our songs, you‚Äôre welcome to download our song sheets or access the Google Docs. They‚Äôre not guaranteed to be 100% correct but they‚Äôre at least mostly right. We just ask for your name and email address so we can keep track of who‚Äôs interested in this project.</p>

      <h2>Viewing on phone or tablet for performing</h2>
      <p>If you want to get these songs onto your phone or tablet for performances, there‚Äôs a nice free app called LivePrompter2 which presents the songs nicely, scrolls them for you, etc.</p>
      <p>The app looks for .txt files using a specific format called ChordPro.</p>
      <p>You can download the .txt files, put them in your own DropBox account (a free account should be enough), and use those with LivePrompter2.</p>
      <p><a href="#">DropBox folder with .txt files for LivePrompter2 use</a></p>
